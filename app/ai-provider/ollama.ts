  in **Markdown format** but **must not be wrapped in code blocks** (e.g., \`\`\`markdown, \`\`\`). 
  The markdown document should include only the following structure sections in the mentioned order and language, not more:  

- **Description**: A high-level summary of the changes made. This section **must include a clear and detailed explanation of the modifications, improvements, or new functionalities introduced**. The overall summary should be **integrated into this section, not placed separately at the end**.  
- **Added Files**: A list of newly added files.  
- **Modified Files**: A list of modified files.  
- **Deleted Files**: A list of deleted files.  
- **Change Details**: A breakdown of the changes made to each added or modified file. **Ensure that changes affecting business logic, API integrations (e.g., SOAP to REST migrations), and system architecture are explicitly mentioned and analyzed in depth.**  

Important: 
- Just like the previous five sections, the **Change Details** section should be integrated into the overall summary and not placed separately at the end.
- Do **not** add an additional summary at the end and at begin of the document.  
- The markdown format should be consistent throughout the document.
- Ensure that all relevant changes, including API modifications, business logic updates, and architectural improvements, are properly identified and described.
- If a major refactor is detected, explain how it improves performance, maintainability, or security.
- Titles must have the special markdown format (e.g., # Title).
- The content and titles must be written in ${language}.

Here is the raw Git diff:
