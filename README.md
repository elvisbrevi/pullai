## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

This tool requires [Bun](https://bun.sh/) to be installed on your system. If you don't have Bun installed, you can install it with:

```bash
# For macOS, Linux, and WSL
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# For Windows (using PowerShell)
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### Using npm

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g pullai

# Or install locally in a project
npm install pullai
```

### Using Bun

```bash
# Install globally
bun install -g pullai

# Or install locally in a project
bun install pullai
```

### Development Installation

If you're developing or modifying the tool, you can link it locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/elvisbrevi/pullai.git
cd pullai

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Link the package for local development
bun link

# Now you can run the tool with
pullai
```

You'll need to set environment variables for the API keys of the AI providers you want to use:

```bash
# For OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# For Deepseek
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-deepseek-api-key
```

Note: The application directly uses these environment variables, not .env files. Make sure to export them in your terminal session before running the application.

## üöÄ Usage

Run the tool with:

```bash
pullai
```

Then follow the interactive prompts:

1. Select the AI provider to use (OpenAI or Deepseek)
2. Select the template to use (Standard, Concise, or Detailed)
3. Select the source branch (branch with changes)
4. Select the destination branch (branch to merge into)
5. Choose your preferred language for the output
6. Enter a name for the output file

The generated file will be saved in the `~/.pullai/outputs/` directory in your home folder, making it easily accessible for future reference.

## üìù Examples

### Example Output

Here's a sample of what a generated PR description might look like:

```markdown
# Description

This PR introduces a major refactoring of the code structure, improving modularity
by separating AI and Git services into individual modules. The change enhances
maintainability and creates a cleaner architecture.

# Added Files

- app/ai-provider/openai.ts
- app/services/git.ts
- app/types/choice.ts

# Modified Files

- package.json
- app/main.ts

# Deleted Files

- src/main.ts

# Change Details

## app/ai-provider/openai.ts

This new file encapsulates all OpenAI API interactions, implementing a dedicated
function `formatContentWithAI` that handles PR description generation with
multilingual support.

## app/services/git.ts

This module contains all Git-related functionality, including methods to retrieve
branch differences and parse Git diffs. It implements proper error handling and
excludes irrelevant files from processing.
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Ignored Files

PULLAI automatically ignores certain files when analyzing diffs:

```typescript
const ignoredFiles = [
  "node_modules",
  ".idea/",
  ".lock",
  ".env",
  ".npmrc",
  ".gitignore",
  "package-lock.json",
];
```

You can modify this list in `app/services/git.ts` to customize which files to exclude.

### File Locations

When PULLAI is installed, it creates the following directories in your home folder:

- `~/.pullai/templates/` - Contains your custom templates
- `~/.pullai/outputs/` - Contains your generated PR descriptions

These directories are created automatically the first time you run the application. The default templates are copied to your templates directory, allowing you to customize them without affecting the original installation.

### Custom Templates

PULLAI supports custom templates for PR descriptions. You can create your own templates by adding markdown files to the `~/.pullai/templates/` directory.

To create a custom template:

1. Create a markdown file (e.g., `my-template.md`) in the `~/.pullai/templates/` directory
2. Use the following placeholders in your template:
   - `{{language}}`: Will be replaced with "English" or "Spanish" based on the selected language
   - `{{diff}}`: Will be replaced with the Git diff content

Example custom template:

```markdown
# PR Summary for {{language}} Review

## Overview

This PR makes the following changes:

{{diff}}

## Checklist

- [ ] Code follows the style guidelines
- [ ] Documentation has been updated
- [ ] Tests have been added/updated
```

When you run PULLAI, your custom templates will appear in the template selection menu alongside the built-in templates.

### AI Models

PULLAI uses the following AI models:

- **OpenAI**: Uses the `gpt-4-turbo` model for generating PR descriptions
- **Deepseek**: Uses the `deepseek-reasoner` model for generating PR descriptions

These models provide high-quality, detailed analyses of your code changes and generate well-structured PR descriptions.
